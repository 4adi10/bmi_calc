# BMI Calculator with GUI

This project is a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Python using `Tkinter`. It allows users to calculate BMI based on weight and height, with support for both metric (kg, cm) and imperial (lbs, inches) units. The app also includes a graph that stores and visualizes previous BMI calculations over time, making it easier to track changes.

## Features:
- Switch between **metric** (kg, cm) and **imperial** (lbs, inches) units.
- Input weight and height, calculate BMI, and visualize the result.
- Historical data storage with trend visualization through a graph.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- Matplotlib (for graph visualization)

## How to Use:
1. Input your weight and height in the respective fields.
2. Select the unit system (Metric or Imperial).
3. Click "Calculate BMI" to see your BMI result.
4. The app will also display a graph of your previous BMI calculations.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/4adi10/bmi_calc.git
